I presented several compelling applications within the field. Regrettably, the presentation was conducted in Portuguese; however, a comprehensive explanation of the discussed topics can be accessed through the following [link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1FQ9M-xaZiH7hCbHod0WNRaahdIc-drhP/view).
