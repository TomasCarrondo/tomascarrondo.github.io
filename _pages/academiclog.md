# October 2023

In the initial part of October, my primary focus was directed towards exploring the applications of path signatures in the context of portfolio optimization [1]. It was during this exploration that I became acquainted with the universality property of signatures, a concept likely to feature prominently in my upcoming thesis. Despite lacking a clear thesis direction, fueled by curiosity, I delved into Stochastic Portfolio Theory and Signature-based methods within this domain, aiming to grasp their implications and potential advantages [2].

However, a significant shift occurred as my attention veered towards kernel learning. The introduction to the Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK) marked a pivotal moment, prompting further exploration into Neural Signature Kernels [4]. In an effort to deepen my comprehension, I undertook the derivation of an explicit expression for the NTK of the controlled ResNets as detailed in [4]. Concurrently, I delved into the tensor programs framework [5,6]. The direct derivation posed challenges with intricate recursions, and the tensor programs raised reservations regarding the arguments presented. Seeking clarification, I reached out to the principal author of [4], learning of progress in deriving an NTK expression, with certain technicalities yet to be resolved. In addition, it's noteworthy to mention that most things related to Deep Learning or Kernel Learning were entirely novel to me, rendering this month particularly enriching in terms of knowledge acquisition.

# September 2023

Initiated the process of selecting supervision for my thesis during this month. By the end of September, I confirmed my academic team, consisting of Prof. Fenghui Yu as the primary supervisor and Prof. Christa Cuchiero as the co-supervisor. Despite the lack of a clearly defined thesis direction, I expressed a keen interest in exploring something related to Rough Path Theory, specifically focusing on Path Signatures. The allure of signatures, discovered in the previous semester, stemmed from their integration of both Analysis and Algebra, providing a compelling intersection that resonated with my academic pursuits. And, beyond their mathematical elegance, signatures offer many practical applications in fields such as Machine Learning and Financial Mathematics. Limited time during the month allowed for only light reading, but this did not hinder progress, as I found myself comfortably ahead of schedule.
