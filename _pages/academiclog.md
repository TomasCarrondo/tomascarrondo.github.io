# September 

Initiated the process of selecting supervision for my thesis during this month. By the end of September, I confirmed my academic team, consisting of Prof. Fenghui Yu as the primary supervisor and Prof. Christa Cuchiero as the co-supervisor. Despite the lack of a clearly defined thesis direction, I expressed a keen interest in exploring something related to Rough Path Theory, specifically focusing on Path Signatures. The allure of signatures, discovered in the previous semester, stemmed from their integration of both Analysis and Algebra, providing a compelling intersection that resonated with my academic pursuits. And, beyond their mathematical elegance, signatures offer many practical applications in fields such as Machine Learning and Financial Mathematics. Limited time during the month allowed for only light reading, but this did not hinder progress, as I found myself comfortably ahead of schedule.
