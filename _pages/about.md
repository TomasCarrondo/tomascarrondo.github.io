I am a Mathematics student pursuing an MSc in Applied Mathematics at TU Delft in the Netherlands, specializing in Stochastic and Financial Mathematics. Originally from Lisbon, Portugal, I earned my bachelor's degree in Mathematics from Instituto Superior TÃ©cnico.

My current research interests encompass Stochastic Analysis, Rough Path Theory, Kernel Learning, and Signature-based methods. Additionally, I have expertise in Topological Data Analysis, specifically in Persistence Homology, which I explored in detail in this [monograph](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1FQ9M-xaZiH7hCbHod0WNRaahdIc-drhP/view).

Presently, I am immersed in my MSc thesis, under the guidance of [Prof. Fenghui Yu](https://fenghuiyu.github.io) and [Prof. Christa Cuchiero](https://homepage.univie.ac.at/christa.cuchiero/index.html). You can find more details in the "Academic Log" tab, where I maintain a concise record of my ongoing work.
